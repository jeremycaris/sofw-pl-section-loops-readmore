Extends the Pagelines Platform 5 Loops addon with the [loops_excerpt_readmore] shortcode, which inserts the excerpt along with a "Read More" link that recognizes the permalink structure (unlink the Pagelines Platform 5 Loops addon [loops_link] shortcode), and adds a checkbox option to nicely display the "Read More" link directly inline at the end the excerpt. The excerpt length defaults to 25 unless otherwise specified: [loops_excerpt_readmore length="40"].
